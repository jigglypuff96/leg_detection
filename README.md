# leg_detection
leg_detection folder contains the images and the trained model for detecting whether human is in front of the camera
seeP folder contains the images (bedroom and living room) and the trained model for detecting if the human is in the proper filed of view of the camera/robot.
seePdemo folder contains the training images (image) and the videos (only for testing) for detecting if human is in the proper filed of view of the camera/robot. Although I used the same CNN model in seeP and seePdemo, but the training data were collected separately.
